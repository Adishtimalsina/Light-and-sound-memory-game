## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
for this pre-work task, I took a help from the following website and resources 
w3schools.com for color and https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html for sound frequencies. For timer which is 20 second, user have to guess the played button before time out and the other feature is user have three chances to guess. I took a help from stack overflow for these two features. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
My biggest challenge on this pre work task was set a timer and again timer had to reset after user guesses the right. For this feature I almost spent more than 4 hours. I had to spend a lot of time on this feature because I did not have enough knowledge to implement functions for this feature. so, I did search on stack overflow and W3schools.com for this. After some research I understand about some function that going to help for this feature such as setInterval and clearInterval. Also, it was little bit hard to make a function for time keep decreasing from 20 second to 0 s. For this feature I made a  function  countDown. I had to put a many different conditions for this function because the condition was not working, I did not give up and keep trying until I get success. On this function I also had to let user know that you lost a game because time is up. After completing this function, I tried to run and it was looking fine until I lost the game and restart again, when I restart the time start decreasing like a millisecond it took 2 second to get to 0 second from 20 second. I stuck on the same function almost one hour, trying to find a bug. The problem was on function playClueSequence(), I did not set time for 20 second. Another challenge was user can have three chances to guess otherwise user will lose the game. For this feature I had to add more logic on guess function so user can use multiple attempts before they lose the game, and user can see how many attempts left. For me on this pre work task debugging stressed me out but I also learn some debugging techniques.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing this prework assignment, I became more curious about web development. I did not have more knowledge about front-end development, while I work on this prework I enjoyed both front-end and back-end and I just feel like I want to learn more about this. I got basic knowledge about user interface from my android app development class at codepath which is still going on. I feel so easy creating user interface by using html and CSS and JavaScript . can we create a webapp only using these three (CSS, JavaScript, and html) ? if not what else we can use to make webapp more user-friendly and how can we make more interesting user interface. This might be because of Iâ€™m not pretty much familiar with JavaScript but I feel difficult working on function and checking them whether they are working properly or not so, I want to learn about how to write a function on efficient way and check them and I want to learn debugging techniques. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project first of all I would make nicer user interface because the first thing is user interface when we open webpage or webapp. I would make it more colorful with photos on button rather than just button and I would add volume button so, user can maximize and minimize just by clicking on vl+ button and vl- button or slider volume button so, user can slide up for increase the volume and slide down for decrease the volume. I would also add a score button to keep track the user points when they click on correct button and when they click wrong button the score decreases by certain number. Also, I would add function that store the highest score of all time.
